NASA Space Planner

1) Project Idea

This is my very first time using GitHub, so I just wanted to try something simple.
The idea is to make a tiny checklist for astronauts so they don’t forget their daily tasks. I don’t really know how to make a big app yet, but this can show how GitHub can help keep things organized for NASA.

2) How it Helps NASA

It’s just a small example, but it could remind astronauts to check their suits, oxygen, and do experiments. I think NASA has a big versions of these checklists, this is just a class assignment.

3) Technologies / Tools

I honestly don’t know many tools yet, so I just used:
GitHub (making this repo)
This README file
(maybe) Java later, but I’m not sure if I’ll get it right

4) How to Run / Use

There’s not much to run yet.
For now, just read the checklist when I add it.
If I figure out the java code, you can run it
